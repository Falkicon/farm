# FAST Web Components Upgrade Plan

## Goals
1. Implement a clean, minimal home page using FAST Web Components
2. Remove Lit dependencies and focus on FAST Element 2.0 with Fabric/Fluent components
3. Establish stable testing patterns for FAST Element components
4. Create one example each of a Fabric and Fluent component

## Technical Approach
1. Package Cleanup
   - Remove Lit-related dependencies
   - Clean up test utilities and configurations
   - Update to latest stable FAST Element 2.0 packages
   - Use the following dependencies:
    ```json
    "dependencies": {
        "@microsoft/fast-element": "2.0.0-beta.26",
        "@fabric-msft/fabric-web": "2.0.0-beta.4",
        "@fabric-msft/theme": "1.0.0-beta",
        "@fluentui/web-components": "3.0.0-beta.74"
    }
    ```

2. Project Structure
   ```
   src/
   ├── frontend/           # Frontend application
   │   ├── components/     # Web Components
   │   ├── config/        # Frontend configuration
   │   ├── styles/        # Frontend styles
   │   └── types/         # Frontend-specific types
   ├── backend/           # Backend application
   │   ├── api/          # API routes
   │   ├── config/       # Backend configuration
   │   └── types/        # Backend-specific types
   ├── shared/           # Shared code
   │   ├── types/        # Shared type definitions
   │   └── utils/        # Shared utilities
   ├── tests/            # All tests
   │   ├── unit/        # Unit tests
   │   └── e2e/         # End-to-end tests
   └── system/           # System monitoring
       ├── components/
       ├── pages/
       └── utils/
   ```

3. Component Implementation
   - Create a minimal home page layout
   - Implement one Fabric component (Card)
   - Implement one Fluent component (Button)
   - Establish proper type definitions and module declarations

4. Testing Infrastructure
   - Implement FAST Element 2.0 native testing patterns
   - Set up proper DOM mocking and cleanup
   - Establish consistent component lifecycle management

## Progress Tracking

### Current Status
- Phase: Project Structure Cleanup
- Progress: 60%
- Current Focus: Organizing project structure and component tests

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Created upgrade plan document
- [x] Identified core components to implement
- [x] Determined technical approach
- [x] Removed Lit-related dependencies
- [x] Started installing FAST Element packages
- [x] Created FAST Element configuration
- [x] Set up main entry point
- [x] Created component directory structure
- [x] Implemented basic home page layout
- [x] Set up index.html
- [x] Removed all Lit-based components
- [x] Cleaned up component directory structure
- [x] Updated configuration for FAST Element 2.0
- [x] Prepared home page for Fabric/Fluent components
- [x] Reorganized project structure
- [x] Cleaned up type definitions
- [x] Moved configuration to appropriate directories
- [x] Moved component tests to proper locations

### In Progress
- [ ] Install and configure Fabric Web Components
- [ ] Install and configure Fluent Web Components
- [ ] Implement Fabric Card component
- [ ] Implement Fluent Button component

### Next Steps
- Complete Fabric/Fluent package installation
- Create Fabric Card component
- Create Fluent Button component
- Add component showcase to home page

### Learnings
1. Project Structure:
   - Frontend configuration belongs in frontend directory
   - Types should be organized by domain (frontend/backend/shared)
   - Tests should be consolidated in a single directory
   - Documentation should live in project root
   - Component tests should live with their components

2. Type Management:
   - Removed generic types in favor of specific component types
   - Using FAST Element's built-in type system
   - Keeping module declarations in shared types
   - Component types stay close to their implementations

3. Component Architecture:
   - Using FAST Element 2.0 without FAST Foundation
   - Leveraging CSS custom properties for theming
   - Following Fabric/Fluent component patterns
   - Keeping components focused and composable
   - Test files co-located with component implementation

### Notes
- Using FAST Element 2.0 without FAST Foundation
- Prioritizing stable architecture over feature completeness
- Successfully removed Lit dependencies
- Basic FAST Element configuration in place
- Home page layout ready for component showcase
- Clean component structure established
- Project structure now follows clear domain separation
- Component tests provide implementation examples
