> - Phase 1 (Basic Components): 45% Complete
> - Type System: ✅ Simplified and Stabilized
> - Documentation: ✅ Framework-Specific Guides Created
> - Current Focus: Form Components & Testing
> - Next Up: Radio Button Component & Integration Tests
> - Key Achievement: Type System Simplification Complete

## Overview
This project aims to systematically explore, test, and document the behavior and capabilities of Microsoft's Fluent UI and Fabric Web Components (beta versions). The goal is to build a comprehensive, practical knowledge base that will inform future migration decisions and serve as a reference for both developers and AI assistants.

## Type System Status ✅

### Component Type Definitions
- [x] Define proper DOM type references
- [x] Implement component-specific interfaces
- [x] Handle event types and handlers
- [x] Support proper type inference

### Package Export Resolution ✅
- [x] Simplified type system approach
- [x] Direct HTMLElement extension
- [x] Removed unnecessary complexity
- [x] Documented type patterns

### Event Handling Types ✅
- [x] Type-safe event handlers
- [x] Component-specific event types
- [x] Proper event target typing
- [x] Event listener options

### Type Migration Strategy ✅
- [x] Document type system differences
- [x] Create type migration patterns
- [x] Handle breaking changes
- [x] Support gradual migration

## Current Focus Areas

### 1. Form Components (In Progress)
- [x] Checkbox Implementation
  - [x] Component Tests
