# Error Fixing Log

## Type System Issues - 2024-01-XX

### Issue 1: Component Type Inheritance and DOM Methods
Components were missing standard DOM methods and properties because they weren't properly inheriting from HTMLElement.

#### Error Messages:
1. Type 'Button' does not satisfy the constraint 'HTMLElement'
2. Property 'setAttribute' does not exist on type 'TextField & ComponentEventTarget'
3. Missing properties from type 'Node': baseURI, childNodes, firstChild, etc.

#### Root Cause Analysis:
1. Component interfaces were extending HTMLElement but not including all required DOM properties
2. ComponentEventTarget interface wasn't including DOM methods
3. Type casting wasn't properly handling the DOM hierarchy

#### Solution Steps:
1. Created a proper `BaseComponent` interface:
   ```typescript
   export interface BaseComponent extends HTMLElement {
       disabled?: boolean;
       form?: HTMLFormElement | null;
       checkValidity(): boolean;
       attachInternals(): DOMElementInternals;
   }
   ```

2. Updated component interfaces to extend BaseComponent:
   ```typescript
   interface Button extends BaseComponent {
       appearance: 'accent' | 'neutral' | 'outline' | 'stealth';
       // ... other properties
   }
   ```

3. Improved type casting in createComponent:
   ```typescript
   function createComponent<T extends BaseComponent>(
       tagName: string,
       definition: FASTElementDefinition<T> | null
   ): T & ComponentEventTarget {
       const element = document.createElement(tagName) as unknown as T & ComponentEventTarget;
       // ... rest of the function
   }
   ```

4. Added proper DOM type references:
   ```typescript
   /// <reference lib="dom" />
   /// <reference lib="dom.iterable" />
   ```

#### Key Learnings:
1. Web Components need to properly extend HTMLElement to inherit DOM functionality
2. Type casting through `unknown` is necessary when dealing with DOM element creation
3. Component interfaces should include all required DOM methods and properties
4. Event handling requires proper type definitions for both the event and the target

#### Best Practices:
1. Always extend BaseComponent for new component interfaces
2. Use proper type casting with `as unknown as Type`
3. Include DOM type references in files dealing with web components
4. Define proper event handler types with correct `this` context

#### Future Considerations:
1. Consider creating a more comprehensive BaseComponent interface
2. Add type validation tests for DOM method availability
3. Document type casting patterns for component creation
4. Consider automating type verification for new components

#### Related Files:
- src/types/global.d.ts
- src/test/type-tests.ts
- src/types/component-bridge.ts

#### Status: In Progress
Still need to:
1. Verify all DOM methods are properly inherited
2. Test component event handling with updated types
3. Document type system changes in TYPE_SYSTEM.md
4. Add type validation tests

### Issue 2: Missing DOM Methods in ComponentEventTarget
Components with ComponentEventTarget were missing standard DOM methods like setAttribute.

#### Error Message:
```
Property 'setAttribute' does not exist on type 'TextField & ComponentEventTarget'
```

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The ComponentEventTarget interface only included event handling methods but was missing standard DOM methods that are needed when working with web components.

#### Solution:
Updated ComponentEventTarget interface to include essential DOM methods and properties:
```typescript
export interface ComponentEventTarget extends EventTarget {
    // Event handling methods remain unchanged...

    // Added DOM methods
    setAttribute(name: string, value: string): void;
    getAttribute(name: string): string | null;
    removeAttribute(name: string): void;
    hasAttribute(name: string): boolean;
    toggleAttribute(name: string, force?: boolean): boolean;

    // Added DOM properties
    id: string;
    className: string;
    classList: DOMTokenList;
    tagName: string;
    textContent: string | null;
    innerHTML: string;
    outerHTML: string;
}
```

#### Key Learnings:
1. When extending EventTarget, we need to explicitly include DOM methods if components need to use them
2. Interface composition (T & ComponentEventTarget) requires all necessary methods to be defined in both types
3. Web Components need access to both event handling and DOM manipulation methods

#### Best Practices:
1. Include all commonly used DOM methods in shared interfaces
2. Document which methods are available through which interface
3. Consider creating separate interfaces for different method categories (events vs DOM manipulation)
