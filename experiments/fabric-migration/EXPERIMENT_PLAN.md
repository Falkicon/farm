# Fluent UI & Fabric Web Components Experiment Plan

> **⚠️ Progress Update - [Current Date]**
> - Phase 1 (Basic Components): 41% Complete
> - Type System: Encountering Package Export Issues
> - Documentation: Self-Documenting System in Place
> - Current Focus: Resolving Type System Integration
> - Next Up: Package Export Resolution & Form Components
> - Key Challenge: Package Export Type Resolution

## Overview
This project aims to systematically explore, test, and document the behavior and capabilities of Microsoft's Fluent UI and Fabric Web Components (beta versions). The goal is to build a comprehensive, practical knowledge base that will inform future migration decisions and serve as a reference for both developers and AI assistants.

## Type System Considerations

### Component Type Definitions ⚠️
- [x] Define proper DOM type references
- [x] Implement component-specific interfaces
- [~] Handle event types and handlers (Blocked by package exports)
- [~] Support proper type inference (Blocked by package exports)

### Package Export Resolution 🔴
- [ ] Resolve @fluentui/web-components export issues
- [ ] Resolve @fabric-msft/fabric-web export issues
- [ ] Create proper type bridges
- [ ] Document package export patterns

### Event Handling Types ⚠️
- [x] Type-safe event handlers
- [~] Component-specific event types (Blocked by package exports)
- [x] Proper event target typing
- [x] Event listener options

### Type Migration Strategy
- [x] Document type system differences
- [ ] Create type migration patterns
- [ ] Handle breaking changes
- [ ] Support gradual migration

### Current Type System Challenges
1. Package Export Resolution
   - Missing exports from @fluentui/web-components
   - Missing exports from @fabric-msft/fabric-web
   - Need for proper type bridges
2. Component Registration
   - Type-safe registration patterns
   - Design system provider types
3. Event Handling
   - Event type inference
   - Component-specific events

## Experiment Categories

### 1. Basic Component Experiments
Purpose: Document individual component behavior and capabilities.

#### Areas to Test:
- Component registration and initialization
- Component attributes and properties
- Event handling and type safety
- Styling and theming
- Slot usage
- Shadow DOM structure
- Performance characteristics
- Type system compatibility

#### Components to Test:
- Buttons (standard, loading)
  - Direct usage of `fluent-button` and `fabric-button`
  - Loading states and disabled states
  - Event handling patterns
  - Type-safe event handlers
- Form elements
  - Text inputs
  - Select components
    - Single and multiple selection
    - Option management
    - Validation handling
    - Type-safe event handling
  - Checkboxes
  - Radio buttons
- Navigation components
  - Navigation bars
  - Menus
  - Tabs
- Data display components
  - Tables
  - Cards
  - Lists
- Layout components
  - Grid systems
  - Stack components

### 2. Integration Experiments
Purpose: Test interaction between Fluent UI and Fabric components.

#### Areas to Test:
- Component co-existence
- Event propagation between components
- Style conflicts and resolutions
- Theme integration
- Performance impact
- Bundle size impact

### 3. Theme Experiments
Purpose: Understand theming capabilities and limitations.

#### Areas to Test:
- Theme registration and application
- Custom theme creation
- Component-specific theming
- Design token usage
- Dark/light mode switching
- Brand customization

### 4. Performance Experiments
Purpose: Measure and document performance characteristics.

#### Areas to Test:
- Component registration overhead
- Initial load time
- Runtime performance
- Memory usage
- Bundle size impact
- Lazy loading capabilities
- Browser compatibility

### 5. Accessibility Experiments
Purpose: Verify and document accessibility features.

#### Areas to Test:
- ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management
- High contrast mode
- Color contrast compliance

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Component Usage**
   - Use direct web component registration
   - Follow Microsoft's component registration patterns
   - Implement proper type definitions

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Test component registration
   - Verify attribute/property behavior
   - Check event handling
   - Validate accessibility features

3. **Documentation**
   - Document registration patterns
   - Record attribute mappings
   - Note behavioral differences
   - Track performance metrics
